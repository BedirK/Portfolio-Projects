**Business Problem**

A game company wants to create new level-based customer definitions(personas) by using some of the features and wants to create segments according to these new customer definitions. Also, they want to estimate how much they can earn on average.

For example: The company wants to determine how much a 25-year-old male user from Turkey, who is an IOS user, can earn on average.

**Dataset History**

The Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users who buy these products. The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. This means that the table is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase.


* Price: Price of the game
* Source: The platform of the game was downloaded
* Sex: Gender of the user
* Country: Country where the user downloaded the game
* Age: Age of the user
