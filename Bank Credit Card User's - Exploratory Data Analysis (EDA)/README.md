## Project Objectives & Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics.

This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of Credit Card Customers data based on their attributes and will include the following steps:


**Data Description**

- 10127 Observations, 14 Different Columns

**Data Understanding**

- Statistical values of numerical columns
- Unique values in each column
- Correlation between the numerical columns
- Descriptive analysis for categorical data

**Data Preparation**

- Missing Values
- General distribution of the numerical variables

**Analysis and Visualization of the data**

- Distribution of Credit Card Holders by Age
- Distribution of Credit Card Holders by Marital Status and Gender
- Distribution of Credit Card Holders by Income Category
- Income Category vs Gender Relation
- Distribution of Credit Card Holders by Education Level
- Distribution of Credit Card Holders by Card Category
- Education Level Outliers - Box Plot
- Card Category Outliers - Box Plot
- Credit Limit - Avg Utilization Correlation


**Conclusions**

In this analysis, the Card Customer Dataset provides insights into the general behavior and categorization of customers.The analysis reveals the following:

- The gender distribution among customers is almost equal.
- The majority of customers fall within the age range of 40-55, with an average age of 46. Middle-aged individuals constitute the largest customer segment for the bank. As a result, the bank has launched special campaigns tailored to this demographic.
- The majority of customers use the Blue card, indicating a preference for basic card options. The bank could explore strategies to increase the usage of other card categories based on customer income levels.
- Most customers have a "Graduate" education level, suggesting a basic understanding of economics among the customer base.
- Male customers tend to have higher credit limits compared to female customers, indicating a higher usage of credit cards among males. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind this disparity.
- The highest income category is predominantly represented by male customers, indicating a potential gap in financial literacy between genders. The bank could consider offering quick training sessions on investing to attract more female customers to this segment.
- Platinum card usage is primarily among middle-aged individuals. Implementing minor changes may help attract customers from other age groups to the bank.

These insights provide valuable information for the bank to tailor its services and offerings to better meet the needs of its diverse customer base.
